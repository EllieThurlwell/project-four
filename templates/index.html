                BCN RUN is a running group focused on people. A friendly, fun and sometimes fast group, we run TOGETHER. We believe that what's most important is enjoying yourself when you run. PBs are nice, but not the be all and end all. However, as we are an inclusive club, there's definitly a place for you if you do want to chase that next record!
            </p>
            <p>
                We meet three times a week in different locations in Barcelona. Each day is a different level run: Beginner for those starting out or who want an easy pace run, Intermediate for those looking to increase distance and/or speed, and Push Yourself for those who want to give it their all on a tougher course. Check out the Events page to see the locations and days!
            </p>

                We hope to see you at a BCN RUN event soon!
